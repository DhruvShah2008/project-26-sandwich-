1. Take 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ tsp chaat masala powder, 1 to 2 green chilies (chopped) in a chutney grinder jar. I usually add 2 to 3 green chilies as we prefer a bit spicy chutney in the sandwiches. You can also add half-half of coriander leaves and mint leaves. Just add a pinch or two of salt, as chaat masala already has salt in it.
2. Grind the chutney ingredients till smooth. no need to add water. But if you cannot grind, then add 1 or 2 tsp of water. I did not add water as there was enough moisture after rinsing the coriander leaves to help them grind to a smooth chutney.
3. Collect the coriander chutney in a bowl. Check the taste and add more salt if required. Cover and keep the chutney aside if you are making sandwiches immediately or else refrigerate. If not using immediately, sprinkle a few drops of lemon or lime juice, so that the chutney color does not darken.
1. Rinse 3 to 4 medium potatoes very well and then steam or cook them in a pressure cooker or steamer. The potatoes should be cooked very well.
2. When the potatoes are warm, peel and mash them with a vegetable masher
3. Heat ½ tbsp oil in a shallow pan and add ½ tsp mustard seeds.
4. When the mustard seeds crackle, add ½ tsp cumin seeds and a pinch of asafoetida. Saute till the cumin seeds splutter and change color. Keep the flame on low so that the spices do not get burnt.
5. Add 1 or 2 green chilies (finely chopped).
6. Then add ¼ tsp turmeric powder
7. stir.
